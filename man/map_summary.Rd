\title{Summarize Genetic Mapping Data}
\usage{
map_summary(
  x,
  type = c("both", "mds", "genome"),
  parent = c("p1p2", "p1", "p2")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A genetic mapping data object, typically containing information about
maps, markers, and related genetic data.}

\item{type}{The type of summary required: 'both', 'mds', or 'genome'.
'mds' refers to Multi-Dimensional Scaling, and 'genome' refers to
the entire genomic data. 'both' will provide information for both
mds and genome.}

\item{parent}{Specifies which parent's data to use in the summary.
Options are 'p1p2' (both parents), 'p1' (first parent), or 'p2'
(second parent).}
}
\value{
An invisible data frame containing the mapping summary,
including linkage groups (LG), chromosome data (Chrom), map lengths,
number of markers per centiMorgan (Markers/cM), information on
simplex markers for each parent, double-simplex, multiplex, total
marker count, and the maximum gap size.
}
\description{
This function provides a summary of genetic mapping data, including information
about marker distribution, map lengths, and gap sizes. It's designed to work with
specific types of genetic data structures in R, offering a concise overview of
the mapping results.
}
\details{
The function processes the mapping data based on the specified 'type'
and 'parent' parameters. It calculates various statistics including
the maximum gap size in the map and the distribution of different
types of markers. The output is formatted as a table for easy viewing
and interpretation.
