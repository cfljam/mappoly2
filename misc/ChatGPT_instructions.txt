Given a binary matrix H with dimesnions (m x p), an integer x representing the
number of '1's in the binary vector v of size p, and a function f(x,y) x'y where '
indicates transposition, i.e., dot product, write an Rcpp function that finds a permutation of
v such that f(v,H[i,]) = d[i] for all i from i to m and return the permuted vector.
If d[i] == NA, skip that iteration. Note that this condition should
be satified for all pairs of (H[i,], d[i]) given a v. If such condition do not exist,
return NA. For this, do not use brute force, i.e., do not generating ass possible
permutations and evaluate them.

For the following example,

H = |1    1    1    1|
    |0    1    0    0|
    |1    0    1    0|
    |1    0    0    0|

x = 2

  and

d = [NA, NA, 2, 1]

the result should be [1,0,1,0], since d[1] and d[2] are NAs and do not provide any
information, d[3] = 2 and the Hamming distance between v = [1,0,1,0] and H[3, ]
equals to 2 and the d[4] = 1 and the Hamming distance between v and H[4, ]
equals to 1

The function worked. Now, instead of returning the first permuted vector, return
all possible UNIQUE permutations of v taht satisfy the conditions presented before.


For the following case:

H =
|1    1    1    1|
|0    1    0    0|
|1    0    1    0|
|1    0    0    0|
|1    0    1    0|
|0    1    0    0|
|1    0    0    1|
|1    1    1    1|
|0    1    0    1|

d =
( NA        NA         1         0        NA        NA         1         0        NA         0 )

and x = 1

returns Error: upper value must be greater than lower value.

while the result should be (0    0    1    0)

ChatGPT is getting lost. Let me restate the question once again:

Given a list of binary matrices, all of them with dimensions (m x p),
write a function in Rcpp to eliminate redundant matrices that can be
generated by permutating columns of any other matrices in the list.

In the case of the follwoing X list:

X[[1]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            1    0    0    0

X[[2]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    1    0    0

X[[3]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    0    1    0

X[[4]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    0    0    1



the result should contain only X[[1]] and X[[3]], since X[[2]] can be generated
by permuting the columns in X[[1]] and X[[4]] can be generated
by permuting the columns in X[[3]]

When entering the following list:

[[1]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            1    0    0    0

[[2]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    1    0    0

[[3]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    0    1    0

[[4]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    0    0    1

the result should be
[[1]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            1    0    0    0
[[2]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            0    0    1    0


and the function is returning

[[1]]
         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
Ch_1_M_1    0    0    1    1
            1    0    0    0
