\title{Plot Multiple Genetic Maps in a Grid Layout}
\usage{
plot_multi_map(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of 'mappoly2.sequence' objects representing the genetic data of biparental populations.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the genetic maps in a grid layout. Each panel shows a
linkage group or chromosome with marker positions and shared frequency across populations.
}
\description{
This function creates a visual representation of genetic maps from different biparental populations.
Each panel in the grid corresponds to a linkage group or chromosome. The maps are displayed
with the marker positions in centimorgans on the Y axis, and the distinct biparental populations
on the X axis. A color gradient from light to dark blue indicates the frequency of markers shared
across populations, providing insight into genetic similarities and differences.
