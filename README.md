# mappoly2
Genetic Linkage Maps in Autopolyploids v 2.0

## Features to be implemented soon

1. [x] DONE ~~Rectify the C++ code to correctly exchange parents with distinct ploidy levels.~~
2. [x] DONE ~~Introduce the functionality to support multilocus analysis for individual parents.~~
3. [x] DONE ~~Prevent underflow in the forward-backward algorithm: probability normalization was employed during both the forward and backward steps. See [this code for more information]("https://github.com/mmollina/mappoly2/commit/ee4d0b8938b0631e377959d4f8f0c6fa27c0c8e7#diff-f405d1ef79df16b745f22994e5c42adddb61716567b5f0d029ce5de6c9b98cadR341")~~
5. [ ] TODO Employing a comprehensive approach that combines two-point phasing with a multilocus likelihood-based method, focusing on complete cases.
6. [ ] TODO Utilizing RcppParallel for the implementation of two-point calculations.
7. [ ] TODO Incorporate emission probabilities into the multilocus approach.
