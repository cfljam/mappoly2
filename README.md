# mappoly2
Genetic Linkage Maps in Autopolyploids v 2.0

## Features to be implemented soon

1. [x] DONE ~~Rectify the C++ code to correctly exchange parents with distinct ploidy levels.~~
2. [x] DONE ~~Introduce the functionality to support multilocus analysis for individual parents.~~
3. [ ] TODO Use long-double for high dimension HMMs
4. [ ] TODO Employing a comprehensive approach that combines two-point phasing with a multilocus likelihood-based method, focusing on complete cases.
5. [ ] TODO Utilizing RcppParallel for the implementation of two-point calculations.
6. [ ] TODO Incorporate emission probabilities into the multilocus approach.
7. [ ] TODO Develop a log-HMM based chain as part of the implementation process (for hexaploids this is pressing).
