\title{Compare Marker Orders from MDS and Genome Maps}
\usage{
compare_order(
  x,
  parent = c("p1p2", "p1", "p2"),
  ncpus = 1,
  error = 0,
  verbose = TRUE,
  tol = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{mappoly2.sequence} object containing the pre-built maps.}

\item{parent}{The parent phase to consider ('p1p2', 'p1', or 'p2').}

\item{ncpus}{Integer specifying the number of CPU cores for parallel processing.
Default is 1 (sequential processing).}

\item{error}{Optional error parameter for comparison adjustments.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints messages during the function execution.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance level for likelihood comparison.}
}
\value{
A matrix comparing the HMM likelihoods of markers across MDS and genome maps.
}
\description{
This function compares two pre-built maps, one using MDS (multidimensional scaling)
and the other using genome order, based on their HMM (hidden Markov model) multilocus-based likelihoods.
It serves as an objective function to assist in selecting the best map by ensuring
that only markers present in both maps are considered for a proper comparison.
