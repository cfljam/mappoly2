# mappoly2
Genetic Linkage Maps in Autopolyploids v 2.0

## Features to be implemented soon

1. Rectify the C++ code to correctly exchange parents with distinct ploidy levels.
2. Introduce the functionality to support multilocus analysis for individual parents.
3. Employing a comprehensive approach that combines two-point phasing with a multilocus likelihood-based method, focusing on complete cases.
4. Utilizing RcppParallel for the implementation of two-point calculations.
5. Incorporate emission probabilities into the multilocus approach.
6. Develop a log-HMM based chain as part of the implementation process (for hexaploids this is pressing).
